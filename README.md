# Power Efficient Distant Controlled Smart Irrigation System for AMAN and BORO Rice

Irrigation is the process of applying appropriate
amount of water to crop fields at needed interim. Irrigation
is an exigent part of cultivation of rice. Although, the overall
yield of rice paddy predominantly depends on proper irrigation,
irrigation process in developing countries like Bangladesh is still
backdated. This study proposes an Arduino/GSM based remotely
controlled power efficient smart irrigation system for crops that
need to be immersed in water during its growing period. It will
ensure the proper irrigation of a field by monitoring water level
of the paddy field, providing feedback to farmers and giving
farmers option to control the water motor via SMS. This study is
expected to improve the overall production of AMAN and BORO
rice of Barishal region by automating the traditional irrigation
system. Also it will provide a more sophisticated irrigation system
for similar types of crops.
